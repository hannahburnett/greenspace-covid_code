# greenspace-covid_code
This repository contains my R code used to analyse data on change in green space use and experiences following UK restrictions on movement. The data are from a YouGov survey conducted from 30th April - 1st May 2020, exploring how green space use, experiences and barriers have changed following UK restrictions on movement enforced due to the COVID-19 pandemic.
